## 1. Composite index
MySQL can only use one index in one query. If multiple columns appear in the search condition, MySQL will pick the most strict index, that is, the one that will retrive the least records.   
We can add EXPLAIN before SELECT to see which index the db choose.  
**Leftmost prefix rule**: a composite index on columns (a, b, c) is like three indexes on (a, b, c), (a, b) and (a). If we search based on (a, c), only the index on a in the composite will be used. For OR clause between conditions on a, b, c, composite index will not be used. 

## 2. Range query
For composite index (A, B):  
1. where A > xx;   useful
2. where A = xx and B > yy;   useful
3. where A > xx and B = yy;   partially useful on A
4. where A > xx and B > yy;   partially useful on A
  
When the query looks like 4 where two columns are all range search, it's better to only add index on A.
## 3. When to use index?
1. Indexes speed up where, order by, group by, so add index on columns that will frequently appear in these clauses.

## 4. When not to use index?
1. Indexes slow down inserts and updates, so you want to use them carefully on columns that are FREQUENTLY updated.
2. Tables with only few records, as database will search index table first and then data table.
3. Columns with lots of common data which distribute evenly
