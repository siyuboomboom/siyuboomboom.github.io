In more detail, in step 11, DNS server for Akamai returns an IP of a CDN global load balancer, and then:
1. user send request to the global CDN load balancer 
2. Global CDN load balancer selects a local load balancer that's near the user's area according to user's IP
3. Local load balancer selects a CDN cache server according to 1) user's IP, 2) which server stores the content requested, 3) load of the server
4. Local load balancer sends the IP of cache server back to global load balancer
5. Global load balancer sends the IP to client
6. User sends request to that cache server
